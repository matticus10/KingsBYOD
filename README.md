# KingsBYOD
This is an example of a project I developed back in 2017 and was my first attempt at using ASP.Net.

I developed this program because previously there was a program for pupils to register problems with personal devices, but this was a local program running on a single machine. I saw the oportunity to create a web based system that would allow pupils to register from their phones or any other web enabled device.

My original intention was for this to be a complete start to finish ticketing system, but I was asked to get the system to email necesary details to Richmand Helpdesk, and kept login details stored within the programs database.
